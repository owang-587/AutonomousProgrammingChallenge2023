Product Design

I. Product Definition
- top speed can't exceed 48km/h (max out at 46 km/h going down slopes)
- right-hand drive of lane 
- within 3m of the each goal (15 total)
- finish objectives within 10 minutes
- time over efficiency?

II. Design Development
- initialize vehicle sensors
- engage vehicle collision movements
- optimize path planning with A* search algorithm
     - use A* for a top level, linear movement algorithm
     - utilize sensors for reaction to the environment during our top level algorithm

III. Submission Flowchart
1-3. ensure vehicle sensor is fully working, collecting all relavent data needed for path planning
4-7. debug vehicle collision movements, use sensor movement and primal vehicle movement to complete track, map track
8-12. create and optimize map planning to compare coordinates and find shortest path
